Revised (IBSS-R) [@sticeTestDualPathway1996].\n\nWithin the BAM group, the effect sizes for SATAQ were as follows:\n\n-   The effect size between baseline and post-session was -0.47, indicating \\[interpretation of effect size\\].\n\n-   The effect size between baseline and 8 weeks was -0.18, indicating \\[interpretation of effect size\\].\n\n-   The effect size between post-session and 8 weeks was 0.27, indicating \\[interpretation of effect size\\].\n\nWithin the Body Project group, the effect sizes for SATAQ were as follows:\n\n-   The effect size between baseline and post-session was -0.41, indicating \\[interpretation of effect size\\].\n\n-   The effect size between baseline and 8 weeks was -0.12, indicating \\[interpretation of effect size\\].\n\n-   The effect size between post-session and 8 weeks was 0.24, indicating \\[interpretation of effect size\\].\n\nFurthermore, the effect sizes for the IBSS-R for the BAM group were:\n\n-   The effect size between baseline and post-session was -0.82, indicating \\[interpretation of effect size\\].\n\n-   The effect size between baseline and 8 weeks was -0.47, indicating \\[interpretation of effect size\\].\n\n-   The effect size between post-session and 8 weeks was 0.2, indicating \\[interpretation of effect size\\].\n\nWithin the Body Project group, the effect sizes for IBSS-R were as follows:\n\n-   The effect size between baseline and post-session was -0.52, indicating \\[interpretation of effect size\\].\n\n-   The effect size between baseline and 8 weeks was -0.47, indicating \\[interpretation of effect size\\].\n\n-   The effect size between post-session and 8 weeks was 0.02, indicating \\[interpretation of effect size\\].\n\n| Measure | Variable      | Group        | Base to Post               | Base to 8wk               | Post to 8wk               |\n|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| GFFS    | gffs_sum_25   | BAM          | -0.51   | -0.35   | 0.16   |\n|         |               | Body Project | -0.61   | -0.6   | 0.01   |\n| UMB-FAT | umb_total_sum | BAM          | -0.59 | -0.25 | 0.33 |\n|         |               | Body Project | -0.24 | -0.06 | 0.14 |\n| SATAQ   | sataq_average | BAM          | -0.47  | -0.18  | 0.27  |\n|         |               | Body Project | -0.41  | -0.12  | 0.24  |\n| IBSS-R  | ibssr_mean_25 | BAM          | -0.82  | -0.47  | 0.2  |\n|         |               | Body Project | -0.52  | -0.47  | 0.02  |\n",
