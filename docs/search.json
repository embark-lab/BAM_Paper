Furthermore, the majority of participants identified as heterosexual (69.7%) followed by bisexual (27.27%). At the time of the intervention, 64 participants reported being students.

    "text": "The Body Advocacy Movement (BAM) is a novel, cognitive-dissonance based intervention designed to target fatphobia and anti-fat bias as mechanisms to drive reductions in eating disorder (ED) risk. Previous dissonance-based programs (i.e., the Body Project; BP) have successfully targeted internalization of appearance ideals as an intervention mechanism. As burgeoning research indicates that fatphobia and anti-fat bias may play a central role in the maintenance of ED pathology, a focused intervention designed to target fatphobia and anti-fat bias could bolster prevention efforts. The aims of this pilot study include confirming acceptability and feasibility of BAM and developing preliminary estimates of its effects on salient intervention targets, along with benchmarking these effects against a similarly-delivered BP intervention. BAM was found to be accepted by participants and feasible to facilitate in a peer-led model. Preliminary results from 50 participants (BAM: N = 26; BP: N = 24) reveal small-to-moderate pre-to- post intervention effects on fatphobia, anti-fat bias, thin ideal internalization, and eating pathology, which dissipated at 8-week follow-up. The BAM intervention has the potential to supplement the existing suite of ED prevention programs by specifically targeting anti- fat bias, though additional efficacy testing in larger and more diverse samples is necessary to clarify its impact on both hypothesized risk mechanisms and ED outcomes."

    "text": "Baseline levels of fatphobia and eating disorder pathology within the sample were assessed to compare to clinical and community norms. Przybyła-Basista et al., (2022) assessed both clinical and non-clinical samples using the GFFS. The clinical sample consisted of 135 females and generated a mean score of 30.1 (SD = 7.7) while the two non-clinical samples (sample 1: N = 296; sample 2: N = 287) both expressed less fatphobia (sample one: mean = 20.3 (SD = 6.8); sample two: mean = 19.6 (SD = 6.8)). The current study’s sample is representative of a community sample by generating a mean baseline score of 18.19(SD = 5.93; R = 5.93- 5.93).\nThe EPSI was also assessed in a community sample of college students (N = 262) and an eating disorder sample (N = 158; Forbush et al., 2013).

Nine items in the survey were presented on a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Analysis of these items indicated generally positive feelings towards the intervention at both time points.
