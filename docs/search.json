Of these, 29 attended the interventions virtually (BAM: N=14, BP: N= 15) beginning 10/20 and ending 02/22 due to the pandemic and 37 attended in-person sessions (BAM: N=24, BP: N=13) between 03/22 to 04/23. Participants ranged in age from 18 – 28 years with the average age being 21.23 years. Participants were mostly women (95.45%) and and the most commonly reported race was White (N = 75.76%). Furthermore, the majority of participants identified as heterosexual (69.7%) followed by bisexual (27.27%). At the time of the intervention, 64 participants reported being students.

    "text": "Baseline levels of fatphobia and eating disorder pathology within the sample were assessed to compare to clinical and community norms. Przybyła-Basista et al., (2022) assessed both clinical and non-clinical samples using the GFFS. The clinical sample consisted of 135 females and generated a mean score of 30.1 (SD = 7.7) while the two non-clinical samples (sample 1: N = 296; sample 2: N = 287) both expressed less fatphobia (sample one: mean = 20.3 (SD = 6.8); sample two: mean = 19.6 (SD = 6.8)). The current study’s sample is representative of a community sample by generating a mean baseline score of 18.19(SD = 5.93; R = 5.93- 5.93).\nThe EPSI was also assessed in a community sample of college students (N = 262) and an eating disorder sample (N = 158; Forbush et al., 2013).

Nine items in the survey were presented on a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Analysis of these items indicated generally positive feelings towards the intervention at both time points.
