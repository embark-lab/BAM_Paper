# Acceptability

Attrition rate for the BAM intervention was 5% with only 2 participants dropping from the study between the first and second sessions, thus confirming our hypothesis of the BAM intervention attrition being less than 20%.

Some participants were also asked to complete a feedback survey about their experience with the BAM intervention at both the post session and 8-week post session time points.
