Attrition rate from session 1 to session 2 was low for both BAM (5%; n = 2) and BP (0%). 
A portion of participants (23%) were also asked to complete a feedback survey about their experience with the BAM intervention at both the post session and 8-week post session time points. Nine items in the survey were presented on a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Analysis of these items indicated generally positive feelings towards the intervention at both time points. The mean scores of enjoyment were 4.60 (SD = .51) at post-session and 4.50 (SD = .65) at 8-week post sessions. All other questions had mean scores above 4.20.
