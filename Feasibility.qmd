# Feasibility

To ensure peer facilitators presented the intervention scripts accurately, all sessions were audio recorded and reviewed by two research coordinators to assess for fidelity. Coordinators rated each intervention section on a score of 0-10 based on how exact facilitators presented the material. The Cohen's Kappa between the two reviewers was k = 0.79, indicating substantial agreement between reviewers. The average score for BAM intervention adherence was N = 8.95 and the Body Project's average score was N = 9.15, confirming our hypothesis that intervention adherence would be greater than 8.0 and suggesting the interventions were both presented with fidelity.
