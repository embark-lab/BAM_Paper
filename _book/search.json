    "text": "Participants (N = 69) were randomly assigned to either the BAM (N=40) or the Body Project (N=29) intervention. Of these, 32 attended the interventions virtually (BAM: N=18, BP: N=16) beginning 10/20 and ending 02/22 due to the pandemic and 37 attended in-person sessions (BAM: N=24, BP: N=13) between 03/22 to 04/23. Participants ranged in age from 18 – 28 years with the average age being 21.23 years. Participants were mostly women (95.24%) and and the most commonly reported race was White (N = 75.76%). Furthermore, the majority of participants identified as heterosexual (69.7%) followed by bisexual (27.27%). At the time of the intervention, 64 participants reported being students.
